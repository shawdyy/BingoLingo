# Bingolingo

This is a web based Bingo game.
On opening the page a random Bingo card gets generated.
You can genereate a new one by refreshing the page in the Browser or open the menu an click "Neue Karte".

If someone of your group has a "Bingo" (every field on the card is marked) you can make a remote check of the card.
Therefore the winner clicks on "Abgleich exportieren" and sends everyone else the string.
Then you can copy the string and click on "Abgleich importieren" and check the fields.
